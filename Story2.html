In a significant leap towards addressing climate change and improving air quality, the U.S. has launched an innovative system called the *GReenhouse gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA²PES). Developed collaboratively by the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)* and the *National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), this advanced research tool promises to revolutionize how we track and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants. Accessible through the **U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center portal*, GRA²PES combines air quality and GHG data into a single, national geospatial database, providing policymakers, scientists, and environmental leaders with powerful tools to address both issues at once.

For decades, environmental managers and researchers have faced a fragmented landscape when it came to data on GHG emissions and air pollutants. Until now, these were often tracked separately, making it difficult to assess how efforts to reduce one type of emission could affect the other. Enter GRA²PES: by unifying data on GHGs like carbon dioxide and methane with pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, this system enables researchers to see the bigger picture—how these emissions interact in the atmosphere and affect air quality on a local and national scale.

*Roisin Commane*, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University, has long been working to refine emissions estimates, particularly in densely populated urban environments like New York City. For her, GRA²PES is a long-awaited solution. "We used to struggle with a mish-mash of datasets that represented information in different ways," Commane explains. "This new system will save us so much time and make our research far more accurate." Her team, like many others, focuses on pinpointing the sources of GHGs, such as those resulting from the burning of fossil fuels. Now, with GRA²PES, they can also map out how these sources contribute to both climate change and poor air quality, all in one place.

### *A New Way to See the Atmosphere*
The story of GRA²PES goes beyond just combining data; it’s about offering a *more complete picture of atmospheric conditions. Since the establishment of the **Clean Air Act in 1970*, environmental regulators have made great strides in tackling air pollution, primarily by targeting point sources like smokestacks and diffuse sources like vehicle emissions. Simultaneously, since the 1990s, the U.S. has been setting national goals to reduce GHG emissions as part of its broader fight against climate change.

However, the atmosphere doesn’t distinguish between these emissions, and neither do the people living in affected areas. A city’s residents, for example, experience poor air quality when GHGs and air pollutants mix together, regardless of their source. GRA²PES addresses this complexity by providing real-time, localized data on both GHGs and air quality pollutants. This helps scientists and policymakers make more informed decisions on how to reduce emissions, leading to cleaner air and a healthier climate.

As Commane notes, GHGs like carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane are often emitted from the same sources that produce air pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). These pollutants freely mix in the atmosphere, contributing not only to climate change but also to the air quality problems that cause respiratory issues and other health hazards in humans. By using GRA²PES, scientists can see how reducing GHG emissions may also improve air quality, revealing previously unseen connections between the two.

Doubling the Benefits of Climate Solutions
One of the most promising aspects of GRA²PES is its ability to *amplify the benefits* of climate solutions. Consider the case of New York City, where researchers like *Brian McDonald* from NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Laboratory have been modeling the impacts of electrifying transportation. McDonald explains that electrification could cut *CO₂ emissions by 43%* and reduce NOₓ, a key air pollutant, by *62%*. This dual impact is vital: by cutting GHGs, not only do we fight climate change, but we also reduce harmful air pollutants that cause asthma, lung disease, and other public health crises.

McDonald emphasizes that this kind of outcome is not unique to New York. Similar reductions in both GHGs and air pollutants can be expected in cities across the U.S., although the scale of these reductions will depend on local sources and activities. By examining geospatial data through GRA²PES, environmental leaders in cities and states can craft tailored solutions that target the most significant sources of pollution in their areas.

A History of Emissions Monitoring*
The U.S. government has long been involved in tracking emissions through programs like the *U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks* and the *Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Emissions Inventory. These systems use **bottom-up methods*—estimating emissions from different activities like energy production, manufacturing, and transportation, then scaling them to regional or national levels. GRA²PES complements these efforts by introducing a more dynamic, localized approach.

New monitoring programs are expanding the reach of GRA²PES through innovative techniques. NOAA and NASA have launched airborne campaigns using instruments on commercial airliners and research aircraft like *NOAA’s Twin Otter* to measure air pollutants across cities. These sensitive tools gather atmospheric data from both ground-based and airborne platforms, giving scientists a real-time snapshot of pollution levels. The data is then fed into models that allow them to infer the sources of emissions, validating and improving the bottom-up estimates developed through traditional methods.

The Future of Environmental Management
GRA²PES represents a *paradigm shift* in environmental management. For decades, air quality managers and GHG managers have operated in separate spheres, each focusing on their own datasets and regulatory goals. But as McDonald points out, *the future will require environmental officials to wear both hats*—managing air quality and GHG emissions in tandem. By leveraging GRA²PES, they’ll be able to develop more effective, equitable policies that target emissions sources and benefit the public health and climate at the same time.

This new tool offers a glimpse into the future of environmental management, where localized data and interactive maps allow policymakers to craft targeted solutions. With real-time information on the sources and trends of emissions, GRA²PES equips officials with the knowledge they need to make faster, more effective decisions. The system's data can be explored using customizable interactive maps, allowing users to zoom in on pollution hotspots, study emission trends, and test out different mitigation strategies.

As climate change continues to reshape the landscape of environmental regulation, GRA²PES is poised to play a critical role. By linking air quality and GHG emissions data, it offers a *comprehensive toolkit* for tackling two of the most pressing issues of our time. The benefits extend beyond cleaner air and a safer climate—GRA²PES could ultimately lead to healthier communities and more sustainable urban environments across the U.S.

In the words of *Brian McDonald, this unified approach is the future: “In the future, air quality managers will be greenhouse gas emissions managers too.*” GRA²PES is the tool that will help them make the leap.</p>    </div>
